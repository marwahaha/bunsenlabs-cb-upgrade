This is a collection of files intended to install
an alpha version of BunsenLabs Linux
on a basic command-line-only Debian Jessie system.
It will use the BunsenLabs repositories on GitHub
to build .deb files, put them in a locally created repository
and install them from there.
The exact content of those files will vary with time,
as will the likelihood of building a viable system.

WARNING: THIS INSTALLER IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
No support will be provided on the forums
for any problems that may occur, though bug reports are welcome!

HOW TO USE

Boot into your Debian Netinstall cli system,
log in and run these commands, as a normal user:
(A fresh copy of this bunsen-netinstall package will be downloaded.)

wget https://github.com/bunsenlabs/bunsen-netinstall/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -xpf master.tar.gz
cd bunsen-netinstall-master
./install

The installation process will start.
Follow any prompts that appear on the screen.

There is also a script: upgrade-bunsen-packages
which can be run to upgrade the BunsenLabs packages
without having to reinstall the system.

A folder called .bunsen-netinstall-logs will be added to your home folder.
(The file ~/.bunsen-netinstall-logs/install.log will contain
verbose information about the install process.)
This folder may safely be removed if the installation was successful,
and no issues arose subsequently.

A folder /backup on your root file system will hold backups of
system files replaced during the install.

The script itself has been separated off from the files holding
specific data about the installation. This is intended to make
customization easier. It should not be necessary to edit "install".
Even if the script is upgraded in the future, the same config files
should still work.

DEBIAN NETINSTALL HINTS

Installing Debian Jessie by the netinstall CD is
similar to using the standard installer.

Two points to watch if you want to use
this netinstall script afterwards:

1) At the "Set up users and passwords" screen,
do NOT enter a password for root.
Type nothing and press "continue".
Do this again at "Re-enter password to verify".
Enter your own name and password as normal.
You will then be given 'sudo' permissions,
which will be needed in the script.

2) At the "software selection" stage DESELECT EVERYTHING
except "standard system utilities".
You will have a core system only, on which
the netinstall installer will add what is needed.
(Some software items will be marked with an asterisk, indicating that
they have been preselected.
Use the up/down arrows to move, and the spacebar to toggle selection.)
