THIS IS FOR UPGRADING CRUNCHBANG Waldorf To BunsenLabs in lue of 
having to get rid of your CrunchBang with all of your files, and 
programs that you already have installed. 

The majority of this script was written by JohnRaff, I just seen
it's potentual then put it to use in using this script to
set the Debian / Crunchbang to an upgrade status so that the
rest of this script will do the rest of the work needed to
do in order to have BunsenLabs installed onto the system, keeping it
as close to a Crunchbang by a different name BunsenLabs as they keep in 
compete control of this process within the use of this script. 

Unless they make major changes to the script that this is just a copy of
that makes major changes to the install process that they use with git.  

It is an Upgrade from Waldorf to Jessie then to BunsenLabs 
Linux or what ever is current in their git repo. It has been set as 
an sub-aplha by the owner and maintainer of BunsenLabs git, I have no
control over this version control. It is there work that they have done
to make Crunchbang live on as best to there abilties. 

I will try to keep this script as close to there as possiable because
this is just a working copy of there script to begin with. I only added 
the abiltiy for it to upgrade a wheezy to Jessie then give up the control to
BunsenLabs to do the rest within the script that was written for test 
purposes. 

Yet BunsenLabs does hold within there git repo a upgrade post install script
to take the existing test purposes only install then upgrade it to the lastest 
BunsenLabs meta packages, incase they update them in the future sence the 
time one has already installed there packages onto there system. 

this implies that it is closer to stable then not, but do play it safe as
a rule to live by, CYA (cover your ass) and Back up all essential files
before upgrading anyhing thing no matter what operating system you choose
to use. 

This is a collection of files intended to install
an alpha version of BunsenLabs Linux
on a basic command-line-only Debian Jessie system,
TTY.

It will use the BunsenLabs repositories on GitHub
to build .deb files, put them in a locally created repository
and install them from there.

The exact content of those files will vary with time,
as will the likelihood of building a viable system.

WARNING: THIS INSTALLER IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
No support will be provided on the forums
for any problems that may occur, though bug reports are welcome!


THIS IS FOR UPGRADING CRUNCHBANG Waldorf TO BunsenLabs in lue of 
having to get rid of your CrunchBang with all of your files, and 
programs that you already have installed. 

It is an Upgrade from Waldorf to alpha version of BunsenLabs 
Linux or what ever is current in there git repo. 

This too can be ran from an NetInstall installation as well 
giving the user the same results. Alpha version of BunsenLabs 
Linux or what ever is current in there git repo. 

HOW TO USE

Boot into your Debian Netinstall cli system,
log in and run these commands, as a normal user:
(A fresh copy of this bunsenlabs-cb-upgrade-netinstall package will be downloaded.)

wget https://github.com/userx-bw/bunsenlabs-cb-upgrade/archive/master.tar.gz

tar -xpf master.tar.gz
cd bunsenlabs-cb-upgrade-master
./install-bl8a

The installation process will start.
Follow any prompts that appear on the screen.

There is also a script: upgrade-bunsen-packages
which can be run to upgrade the BunsenLabs packages
without having to reinstall the system.

A folder called .bunsen-netinstall-logs will be added to your home folder.
(The file ~/.bunsen-netinstall-logs/install.log will contain
verbose information about the install process.)
This folder may safely be removed if the installation was successful,
and no issues arose subsequently.

A folder /backup on your root file system will hold backups of
system files replaced during the install.

The script itself has been separated off from the files holding
specific data about the installation. This is intended to make
customization easier. It should not be necessary to edit "install".
Even if the script is upgraded in the future, the same config files
should still work.

DEBIAN NETINSTALL HINTS

Installing Debian Jessie by the netinstall CD is
similar to using the standard installer.

Two points to watch if you want to use
this netinstall script afterwards:

1) At the "Set up users and passwords" screen,
do NOT enter a password for root.
Type nothing and press "continue".
Do this again at "Re-enter password to verify".
Enter your own name and password as normal.
You will then be given 'sudo' permissions,
which will be needed in the script.

2) At the "software selection" stage DESELECT EVERYTHING
except "standard system utilities".
You will have a core system only, on which
the netinstall installer will add what is needed.
(Some software items will be marked with an asterisk, indicating that
they have been preselected.
Use the up/down arrows to move, and the spacebar to toggle selection.)
