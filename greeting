This is an experimental installer for BunsenLabs Linux.
It will use the bunsenlabs repositories on GitHub
to build .deb files, put them in a locally created repository
and install them from there.
The exact content of those files will vary with time,
as will the likelihood of building a viable system.

Please consider this as purely for TESTING purposes!
